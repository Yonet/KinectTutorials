HelloKinect Overview
========================================================================

This project contains a very basic "Hello World" app for Kinect (written in C++).
Written by Julia Schwarz, 2011. Note that your reference settings may be different
than mine, so be sure to follow instructions available from http://www.codingbeta.com/?p=24 to configure your project correctly, as you'll likely have different paths to the libraries you'll be importing.

HelloKinect.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features.

HelloKinect.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

HelloKinect.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named HelloKinect.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
